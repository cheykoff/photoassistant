This is a playground. 

The goal is to simplify the process of sorting and culling of photos.

Sorting
1. Create folders for years, months, days
2. Rename photos to the format "YYYYMMDD-hhmmss" based on the capture datetime.
3. Move photos to the correct folder.

Culling
4. Find duplicate photos and keep only one of them.
5. Find similar photos and mark the best one.
6. Tag all photos with people.
...

Shouldn't break lightroom catalogues.


Status:
Create directories for YYYY, MM, DD (but so far always 31 days)
test if creation of folders work and teardown

Next:
create directories for each real calendar day
test the function itself
